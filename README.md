# HABs Drivers

###### Project Description

Investigate the patterns, drivers, and risk of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms and toxins in the lakes of the conterminous United States. Combine data from the EPA's National Lakes Assessments, LakeCat, and National Nutrient Inventory in spatially-explicit statistical models to examine the variables associated with cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins among lakes in the US. The project goal is to estimate the risk of cyanobacteria blooms and cyanotoxins in a large number of US lakes.
