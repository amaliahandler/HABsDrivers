\format{
A data frame with 124529 rows and 19 variables:
\describe{
\item{COMID}{A site ID assigned to a lake (character)}
\item{DSGN_CYCLE}{The year of the NLA survey cycle (2007, 2012, 2017)}
\item{UNIQUE_ID}{A unique ID assigned to each lake sampled across NLAs (NLA_STATE-NUMBER)}
\item{n_dev_inputs}{Annual total nitrogen inputs from development (non-farm) into the watershed, mean of 2002, 2007,
and 2012 National Nutrient Inventory (kg N/ha)}
\item{n_farm_inputs}{Annual total nitrogen inputs from agricultural activities into the watershed, mean of 2002, 2007,
and 2012 National Nutrient Inventory (kg N/ha)}
\item{p_dev_inpts}{Annual total phosphorus inputs from development (non-farm) into the watershed, mean of 2002, 2007,
and 2012 National Nutrient Inventory (kg P/ha)}
\item{p_farm_inputs}{Annual total phosphorus inputs from agricultural activities into the watershed, mean of 2002, 2007,
and 2012 National Nutrient Inventory (kg N/ha)}
\item{BFIWs}{Base flow index (percent of total flow that is base flow) for the lake watershed
from LakeCat (percent)}
\item{Precip8110Ws}{30-year mean annual precipitation for the lake watershed, 1981-2010,
from LakeCat (mm)}
\item{Tmean8110Ws}{30-year mean annual air temperature for the lake watershed, 1981-2010,
from LakeCat (per mil)}
\item{fst_ws}{NLCD forested land cover including coniferous, deciduous, and mixed forest.
Data are paired as follows: NLA 2007 - NLCD 2006, NLA 2012 - NLCD 2011,
NLA 2017 - NLCD 2016 (percent)}

\item{AG_ECO3}{The aggregated 3 ecoregional location of the lake (character)}
\item{lake_area}{Lake surface area in square meters}
\item{Shape}{The centroid of the lake (point)}
\item{pred_cyano}{Predicted cyanobacteria cell abundance (cells/mL) log transformed: log10(cyano+1000)}
\item{cyano_transform}{Predicted cyanobacteria cell abundance (cells/mL)}
\item{pred_micx}{Predicted risk of microcystin concentration detection above 0.1 ug/L in percent}
\item{micx_transform}{Predicted risk of microcystin concentration detection above 0.1 ug/L transformed by 10^(micx) - 1000}
